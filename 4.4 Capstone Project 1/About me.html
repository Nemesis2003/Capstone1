    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello there! I'm Bappaditya Velu, a passionate and creative individual
      navigating through the journey of life. Currently in my third year of
      college, I find joy and inspiration in various facets of life. Let me
      share a bit about who I am and what makes me tick.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I hail from the culturally rich city of Kolkata, India, where every corner
      tells a story and history merges seamlessly with the present. This vibrant
      backdrop has undoubtedly influenced my perspectives and ignited my
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <h2>Academic Pursuits</h2>
    <p>
      As a dedicated college student, I am pursuing [Your Major or Field of
      Study] with a fervor for learning and expanding my horizons. The academic
      environment has not only sharpened my intellect but also nurtured my
      ability to think critically and approach challenges with creativity.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond the academic realm, I am an avid anime enthusiast. The world of
      animated storytelling captivates me, and you'll often find me immersed in
      the vivid narratives and unique artistry that anime offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing is another passion that allows me to express my creativity. From
      sketching characters inspired by my favorite anime to creating original
      pieces, my sketchpad is a canvas where imagination comes to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not engrossed in anime or sketching, you might catch me
      binge-watching web series. I appreciate the art of storytelling, and web
      series, with their diverse plots and characters, provide a captivating
      escape into different worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Books are my constant companions. Whether exploring the classics or
      delving into contemporary literature, I find solace and inspiration in the
      written word. Reading is not just a hobby; it's a journey of
      self-discovery and intellectual exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, there are the quiet moments under the night sky, where I find
      myself marveling at the stars. The vastness of the cosmos serves as a
      reminder of the beauty and mysteries that exist beyond our daily lives.
    </p>
